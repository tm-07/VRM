# VRM
A Vendor Relations Managements Platform (VRM) designed for non-profit organizations

### Getting Started
This web application is a proof-of-concept, designed for Make-A-Wish during the Hack-A-Wish hack-a-thon. It is designed to make managing vendors and partner businesses as easy as possible. The vendor search allows wish coordinators to collaboratively keep track of and store the information for local businesses, services, and individuals they have worked with, which can help speed up the process of finding partners to help grant wishes.
